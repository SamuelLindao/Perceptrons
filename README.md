Perceptron Project... This is an amazing thing that I did, with my advisor and teacher Cesar Alberto Bravo Pariente.

The project is composed of 3 parts + 2 auxiliaries.
A perceptron responsible for checking the RGB layers and removing the region of non-interest.
A horizontal perceptron that removes the layers of non-interest horizontally, by position.
A vertical perceptron that removes the layers of non-interest vertically, by position.
An image processing responsible for merging the images so that 2 images come together and form 1 lighter one. Enabling a more optimized development.
An image processing responsible for checking the skin layers (the edges of the images). Enabling an even more optimized visualization.
